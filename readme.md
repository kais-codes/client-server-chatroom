Hello! This is a simple project from my networking class which uses python sockets to create a chatroom. As of right now, you can use PyCharm to run the client.py first then the server.py files to initiate a connection. Use the client app to start the conversation, then you are able to have a conversation back and forth using each client. Anytime "/q" is enetered into the chat, the connection will be closed for both ends. Thank you for reading!
